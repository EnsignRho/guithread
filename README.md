A repository to demonstrate how to create a tiny VFP9 app
capable of being spawned from a parent app, one which can
receive a command instruction on how to instantiate and
prepare itself on-screen.

It binds to the Windows message thread listening to one
specific message to exit itself.

It also has a manual "exit" label which be removed.

It is not yet complete (as of November 7, 2012), but I
have too many things on my plate to devote much time to
this project at the current time.  However, apart from
debugging and a little refactoring, everything should
be here to make it work.  Just needs proper assembly
and testing.
